  "body": "# Libopencad\r\nOpenSource library under X11/MIT license for everyday use. Under development, but some of basic functionality is already available.\r\n\r\nAll help will be very good for project. A lot of TODO's in code, so you can fix something you want.\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n---\r\nLibopencad typical usage pipeline is shown below:\r\nOpen CAD file:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n# include \"lib/opencad_api.h\"\r\n\r\nCADFile * opendwg = OpenCADFile(\"/path/to/example.dwg/dxf\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom now on, you can access geometries like this:\r\n```cpp\r\nsize_t nLayersCount = opendwg->GetLayersCount();\r\nLayer * layer;\r\nfor ( auto i = 0; i < nLayersCount; ++i )\r\n{\r\n    layer = opendwg->GetLayer (i);\r\n    for( auto j = 0; j < layer->GeometriesCount(); ++j )\r\n    {\r\n        CADGeometries::CADGeometry * geom = layer->GetGeometry (j);\r\n        // now, geom->sGeometryType stores a type of returned geometry. Then,\r\n        // you have to cast it to this class, eg.\r\n        if ( geom->sGeometryType == CADGeometries::CADGeometryType::CIRCLE )\r\n        {\r\n            CADGeometries::Circle * circle = geom;\r\n            // There you go. Now you can get all the data you want, eg.\r\n            std::cout << circle->dfCenterX;\r\n            std::cout << circle->dfCenterY;\r\n            std::cout << circle->dfCenterZ;\r\n            std::cout << circle->dfRadius;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent features list:\r\n1. Added reading of layers.\r\n2. Added reading of geometries: Text, Point, LWPolyline/Polyline2D/Polyline3D, Arc, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Spline.\r\n\r\nUp on the list:\r\n1. Reading of attributes.\r\n2. Reading of blocks.\r\n\r\nNow supported CAD files version are:\r\n\r\n1. R2000 (read-only). Its under development still, and a lot of geometries are missed, but it will all come with time.\r\n2. Next up on the list: R2004.\r\n\r\nBuild status\r\n------------\r\nLinux: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sandyre/libopencad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sandyre/libopencad)\r\n",
