Under development, but some of basic functionality is already available.\r\n\r\nAll help will be very good for project. A lot of TODO's in code, so you can fix something you want.\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n---\r\nlibdwgx typical usage pipeline is shown below:\r\nOpen .DWG file:\r\n```cpp\r\nDWGFile * opendwg = libdwgx::InitializeDWG(\"/path/to/example.dwg\");\r\n\r\nopendwg->ReadHeader();\r\nopendwg->ReadObjectMap();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom now on, you can access geometries like this:\r\n```cpp\r\nint geometries_count = opendwg->GetGeometriesCount();\r\nfor(auto i = 0; i < geometries_count; ++i)\r\n{\r\n    libdwgx::DWGGeometries::Geometry * geom = dwgfile->ReadGeometry (i);\r\n    // now, geom->sGeometryType stores a type of returned geometry. Then,\r\n    // you have to cast it to this class, eg.\r\n    if ( geom->sGeometryType == libdwgx::DWGGeometries::DWGGeometryType::CIRCLE )\r\n    {\r\n        libdwgx::DWGGeometries::Circle * circle = geom;\r\n        // There you go. Now you can get all the data you want, eg.\r\n        std::cout << circle->dfCenterX;\r\n        std::cout << circle->dfCenterY;\r\n        std::cout << circle->dfCenterZ;\r\n        std::cout << circle->dfRadius;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow supported DWG version are:\r\n\r\n1. R2000 (read-only). Its under development still, and a lot of geometries are missed, but it will all come with time.\r\n2. Next up on the list: R2004.\r\n\r\nBuild status\r\n------------\r\nLinux: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sandyre/libdwgx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sandyre/libdwgx)\r\n",
